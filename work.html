    <section class="intro">
        <p>Ever wondered how your favourite snacks would look on a lab report?
            Lets get diagnostics-with humor and a touch of science.</p>
    </section>
  <div class="snacklist">
        <h2>Fries</h2>
      
        <p>The saltier the tastier, mmh right? Let's talk normal "results"—  
        golden, perfectly crispy fries, ooh, and not too oily—perfect 👍.  
        Just like a CBC that's within range.</p>
      
        <p>Pale, undercooked fries—look tired and pale.  
        Just like your red blood cells when you have anemia.</p>
      
        <p>Fries with extra ketchup? A mess!  
        This is like a high white blood cell count—your body is sending backup to fight an infection.</p>
      
        <p>Dry, shriveled fries—where’s the juice?  
        These fries need fluids, just like your body does when sodium is too high.</p>
      
        <p>Over-salted, sugar-dusted fries—knock knock, who's there?  
        Diabetes! Too much seasoning = too much glucose in the blood.</p>
      
        <p>Fries soaked in oil—fatty and overloaded.  
        Your liver is screaming: the enzymes are too high!</p>
      
        <p>Fries stuck together? Clotting disorder alert.  
        When clotting factors are off, that’s how your platelets behave.</p>
      
        <p>So… what kind of results are your fries serving? I'd like to know. 🍟</p>
      
        <h2>Burgers</h2>
      
        <p>I love me some chicken burger—what about you?</p>
      
        <p>A well-built burger: bun, lettuce, patty, tomato—everything in the right place.  
        That’s your CBC, LFTs, and glucose—all normal. Thumbs up to the chef! 👨‍🍳</p>
      
        <p>A burger dripping in grease and cheese = high cholesterol.  
        Looks tasty, but this one's a lipid profile nightmare. LDL up, HDL down—those arteries are not happy.</p>
